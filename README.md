# fullstack-sketchbook
It is a collection of real-life inspired web projects built from identifying everyday problems and designing thoughtful, end-to-end solutions.



Every project in this repository started with a moment of noticing — a small inefficiency, a missing tool, a broken workflow, or a frustrating user experience — and asking:
“What if I tried to fix this?”

Without client requests or assignments, I design and build solutions purely from curiosity, empathy, and problem-solving. This makes each project a living case study of real-world product thinking.

This sketchbook documents my journey of:

→ Seeing problems
→ Asking better questions
→ Designing thoughtful solutions
→ Engineering them into reality

It’s a space to learn, experiment, fail, refine, and grow as a full-stack developer.
